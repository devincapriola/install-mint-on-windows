# Install Mint on Windows

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the process of installing Linux Mint on a Windows computer. Linux Mint is a popular Linux distribution known for its user-friendly interface and stability. By dual-booting Windows and Linux Mint, you can have the flexibility of using both operating systems on the same machine.

### **Please note before you begin, make sure you have the following:**
 1. A Windows computer with sufficient free disk space for Linux Mint installation.
 2. A USB flash drive with a capacity of at least 4GB.

## Instructions to Download Mint

1. Visit the official Linux Mint website at: https://linuxmint.com 

2. Navigate to the "Download" section and choose the edition of Linux Mint you want to install (e.g., Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce).

3. Select the 64-bit version of the ISO file unless you have a specific reason to choose the 32-bit version.

4. Click on the download link to start downloading the Linux Mint ISO file.

## Creating a Bootable USB Drive
1. Insert the USB flash drive into your computer.

2. Download and install a tool called Rufus from the official website at: https://rufus.ie

3. Open Rufus and select your USB drive from the "Device" dropdown menu.

4. In the "Boot selection" section, click on the "Select" button and browse to the location where you saved the Linux Mint ISO file. Select the ISO file and click "Open".

5. Ensure that the partition scheme is set to "MBR" and the file system is set to "FAT32".

6. Click on the "Start" button to begin creating the bootable USB drive. **Note that all data on the USB drive will be erased during this process, so make sure to back up any important files.**

7. Rufus will display a warning that all data on the USB drive will be destroyed. Click "OK" to proceed.

8. Rufus will now format the USB drive and copy the Linux Mint ISO file onto it. This process may take a few minutes.

9. Once the process is complete, Rufus will display a message indicating that the bootable USB drive has been created successfully. You can now close Rufus.
